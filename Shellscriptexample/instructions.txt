=============
- Supported set of languages: Python, Java, C++.
- Store all the relevant files in a folder and submit the corresponding zipfile (.zip).
- The folder should have a script file named "run_code.sh".
- Executing run_code.sh should do all the necessary steps required for the code execution like compiling, linking and execution
- Assume relative file paths in your code i.e. "./filename.txt" or "../hw1/filename.txt" instead of "/never/use/this/file/format" or "C:/definitely/not/this/format/"

- The output should be dumped in a "output.txt" file in the format specified:

OUTPUT A
FRO11987 FRO12685 0.4325
FRO11987 ELE11375 0.4225
FRO11987 GRO94758 0.4125
FRO11987 SNA80192 0.4025
FRO11987 FRO18919 0.4015
OUTPUT B
FRO11987 FRO12685 DAI95741 0.4325
FRO11987 ELE11375 GRO73461 0.4225
FRO11987 GRO94758 ELE26917 0.4125
FRO11987 SNA80192 ELE28189 0.4025
FRO11987 FRO18919 GRO68850 0.4015

Explanation:
- Line 1 should have "output A" string
- Next five lines should have the top five sets with decreasing confidence scores for a part of the question.
	- Format: <item1> <item2> <cofidence score>
- Line 7 should have "output B"
- Next five lines should have the top five sets with decreasing confidence scores for b part of the question
- Assume any case (upper or lower)

- To reemphesize, make sure when the run_code.sh is executed the output.txt file is dumped
- Zip the entire folder and submit it with your <student_id>.zip format. eg. 11xxxxxx.zip


- If you do not have any programming experience, recommend starting with Python since it is easy to learn.
